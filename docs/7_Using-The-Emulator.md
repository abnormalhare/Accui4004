# Using the Emulator
Using the emulator is quite simple. There's not much to learn.
## The CPU Output screen
On this page, you'll see everything that the CPU has going on inside it. Using the left and right arrow keys allows you to view the 32 different RAM chips implemented.
## The Display screen
Pressing R will change the screen to show the 8 x 8 display plugged into the machine. This is where games can output data if they don't want to use RAM! It is quite hard tho, try looking inside the display.i4a file in `assembler/`!
