# Intel 4004
The Intel 4004 has a very simple structure compared to the current chips, or even compared to the NES. Let's start from the outside and work our way in.
## Pins
The chip has 16 pins able to be connected to the motherboard to send data to other parts of the board.
### Data Bus
The communication layer between itself and its components. It holds 4-bits at a time.
### CM-RAM
4-bits of data output for selecting RAM chips.
### CM-ROM
A single pin output that signals when memory is needed.
### Vss
The highest voltage. Essentially Hi
### Vdd
Lo voltage.
### Clock Phase 1 & 2
Two different clock phases for each clock cycle.
### Sync
A single input used to ensure a chip doesn't deviate from the current cycle.
### Test
Able to be checked using an instruction. Could be used for a number of things, including verification of successful communication of different chips.
### Reset
A single input that sets all registers and flags to 0
## Timing
There are parts in the CPU that deal with time: the control area and the instruction decoder. The control area deals with the pins, which is simply an input to the clock. The instruction decoder allows the CPU to work on "instruction cycles," which are 8 clock cycles long.
### Cycles A1-A3
These cycles are for the sole purpose of send the 12-bit program counter to the ROM, from high to low nibble
### Cycles M1-M2
These cycles are used for the ROM to send data to the CPU. It sends an 8-bit number from high to low.
### Cycles X1-X3
These are for the CPU to interpret the instruction, as well as other components.
## The ALU
The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is where the CPU does its math. It does very little, only adding and subtracting. It uses the 4-bit accumulator, as well as a temporary register containing the specified normal register sent in the command. It also contains a standard carry flag as well as a decimal adjust unit, which sets the carry bit if a number is above 9 and uses it and the resulting accumulator as a decimal number.
## The Stack
The 4004 has 4 12-bit stack registers. The first stack register is the program counter. The whole stack can be shifted up for a function call, or shifted down for a return, but be aware that more than 3 internal function calls breaks this system.
## The Registers
The 4004 has 16 4-bit registers which can sometimes be used as 8 8-bit registers when working with certain commands.
## The Bus
The 4004's bus is a 4-bit buffer used for sending data across and outside the chip.
