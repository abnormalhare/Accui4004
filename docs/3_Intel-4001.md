# Intel 4001
The Intel 4001 has an even simpler system for sending and recieving data. Let's look at it in the same way as the CPU
## Pins
The chip has 16 pins for communication between the CPU and I/O Chips.
### Data Bus
Outputs the current interal bus, and is only accessed when the ROM is recieving an address or I/O data.
### I/O Lines
Reads data from the CPU, or writes data to the CPU, using whatever is connected to the I/O lines.
### CM-ROM
A single pin input that signals when memory is needed.
### Vss
The highest voltage. Essentially Hi
### Vdd
Lo voltage.
### Clock Phase 1 & 2
Two different clock phases for each clock cycle.
### Sync
A single input used to ensure a chip doesn't deviate from the current cycle.
### Reset
A single input that sets all registers and flags to 0
## CL
Clears the I/O buffer.
## Timing
Timing is the same as the CPU. It uses the same 8-cycle instruction cycle.
### Cycle A1
The ROM checks whether or not it is the correct ROM chip to send data.
### Cycles A2-A3
The ROM gets the address sent by the CPU
### Cycles M1-M2
The ROM sends the data at the current address to the CPU in 4-bit increments. This is why I use a 4-bit structure for the ROM.
### Cycles X1-X3
This is only used when specific instructions by the CPU
## Static Data
The 4001 has certain data that cannot be mutated because it is built into the ROM during manufacturing. This is the chip number, set to a number between 0 and 15, and the ROM data.
## Instructions
The ROM can do very primitive things when the CPU tells it to, solely for communication with other devices.
### Send Register Control
The ROM checks against the bits sent on X2 to see if it is the correct ROM chip
### Write ROM Port
The specified ROM sets the I/O bits to what the CPU sends it. This will continue to be true until new data is sent to it.
### Read ROM Port
The specified ROM reads data at the I/O ports. It can also both send and recieve 2 bits of data if the CPU sends 1XX0 with the command, where X is the output bits.
