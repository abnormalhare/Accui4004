# Accui4004
This is a (almost sub-)cycle accurate emulator of the Intel 4004 Chip written in Zig. This is my first real project I've completed in Zig and it was really cool to work on. Information on how to make a program for this is [here](docs/1_Getting-Started.md)

## How to build
This requires Zig to build. Zig's latest version can be downloaded [here](https://ziglang.org/download)
Build using `zig build`. The command arguments are `Intel4004Emu.exe [filename].i44`.
