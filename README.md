# Intel 4004 Emulator
This is a clock-cycle semi-accurate emulator of the Intel 4004 Chip written in Zig. This is my first real project I've "completed" in Zig and it was really cool to work on. Information on how to make a program for this is [here](docs/1_Getting-Started.md)

## How to build
Build using `zig build` and make sure `input.i44` is in the same directory as the executable.
